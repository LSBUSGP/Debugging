# Debugging

A tutorial on Unity debugging techniques.

## Project setup

First create a new project. You can create any type, I'm creating a standard 3D project and calling it `Debugging`.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you need to update the Visual Studio package in the `Package Manager`. If you are using Visual Studio, you might not need to perform this step. First click on the `Visual Studio Editor` package, then click on the `Unlock` button.

Then click on `Version History` and then on the `Update` button.

If you are opening Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for the first time, everything should work. But if you previously opened either editor, before updating the package, you might need to reset the project files. To do this, open `Preferences...` from the `Edit` menu.

Select `External Tools` from the list on the left, and `Visual Studio` or `Visual Studio Code` as the `External Script Editor` and finally click the `Regenerate project files` button.
